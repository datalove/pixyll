The datalove blog is crafted with <3 by [Tommy O'Dell](http://tommyodell.com)
([@tommyodell](https://twitter.com/tommyodell)), lover of all things data, and an electrical engineer turned analyst/statistician/data scientist
from the beautiful island of Newfoundland. Now living in sunny Perth, Western Australia.

The blog runs on an open-source Jekyll theme called [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/) built by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) and available
on [Github](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).
